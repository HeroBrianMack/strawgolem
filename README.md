# Straw Golem Reborn
This mod adds a helpful (and awfully cute) little golem to do some of your farming for you. It can harvest, replant and deliver crops to a nearby chest.

## Getting Started
To create a Straw Golem, stand near the crops or farm where you want it to do its thing. Then place a carved pumpkin on top of a hay bale. (Or carve a pumpkin that is already on a hay bale). After a moment of reflection about the life, the universe, and everything, your little guy will start look for & harvest a full-grown crop.

## Chest Usage
Once a Straw Golem gathers a crop item, it will seek out a chest to store the item. Thus, a chest should be placed near the crops where the golem does its work, and you should make sure the chest have available space inside to hold the soon-to-be harvested crops. 
- Your golem is usually clever enough to locate an available chest on its own. 
- If you have more than one chest in the vicinity, the golem will choose a chest on its own


## Lifespan
The Straw Golem has a limited lifespan.
- Every 10 minutes, theres a 1/5 chance it decays.
- There are 4 decay states, from new to dying, with death thereafter
- This lifespan goes down faster when the golem is exposed to the rain or when it stands in water
- The golem shivers when in rain water or cold
- You can protect your golem from rain by building it a Straw Hat
- The golem decays if it takes enough damage
- Lifespan is restored by feeding the golem wheat, which also heals it. 

As your golem approaches old age, it will begin to to decay, and you will see visual changes to its texture. You may also start to see flies hovering about. Moreover, as it ages, its max lifespan is lowered.

## Behaviour
- The golem is shy, and tends to avoid players
- The golem will be attacked by all raiders, and will flee them
- The golem will sometimes be munched on by farm animals, and will flee them
- When the golem flees, it drops anything it had in its hand

## Config
The mod is made to be highly configurable. Users can toggle optional features (lifespan, hunger, etc.), set crops to include/exclude, tweak lifespan & hunger lengths, etc.

## Compatibility
The mod has out-of-the-box compat for most modded crops. It also plays nice with many tooltip GUI mods, such as HWYLA, WTHIT, and Jade, so you can see golem health, hunger, and remaining days.
